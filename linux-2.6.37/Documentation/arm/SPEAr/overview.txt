			SPEAr ARM Linux Overview
			==========================

Introduction
------------

  SPEAr (Structured Processor Enhanced Architecture).
  weblink : http://www.st.com/spear

  The ST Microelectronics SPEAr range of ARM9/CortexA9 System-on-Chip CPUs are
  supported by the 'spear' platform of ARM Linux. Currently SPEAr300,
  SPEAr310, SPEAr320, SPEAr600, SPEAr1300 and SPEAr1310 SOCs are supported.
  SPEAr3XX and SPEAr6XX are based on ARM9 whereas SPEAr13XX is based on latest
  ARM Cortex A9 CPUs.

  Hierarchy in SPEAr is as follows:

  SPEAr (Platform)
	- SPEAr3XX (3XX SOC series, based on ARM9)
		- SPEAr300 (SOC)
			- SPEAr300_EVB (Evaluation Board)
		- SPEAr310 (SOC)
			- SPEAr310_EVB (Evaluation Board)
		- SPEAr320 (SOC)
			- SPEAr320_EVB (Evaluation Board)
	- SPEAr6XX (6XX SOC series, based on ARM9)
		- SPEAr600 (SOC)
			- SPEAr600_EVB (Evaluation Board)
	- SPEAr13XX (13XX SOC series, based on ARM CORTEXA9)
		- SPEAr1300 (SOC)
			- SPEAr1300_EVB (Evaluation Board)
		- SPEAr1310 (SOC)
			- SPEAr1310_EVB (Evaluation Board)
		- SPEAr900 (SOC)
			- SPEAr900_EVB (Evaluation Board)

  Configuration
  -------------

  A generic configuration is provided for each machine family, and can be used as the
  default by
	#make ARCH=arm spear13xx_defconfig
	#make ARCH=arm spear3xx_defconfig
	#make ARCH=arm spear6xx_defconfig

  Compilation
  -----------

  After applying default configuration, Linux kernel for SPEAr architecture
  can be compiled as
	#make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- uImage

  Please note that ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE can be omitted in the command line
  provided that they are properly defined in the shell variable environment:

  export ARCH=arm
  export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-ca9-linux-

  Layout
  ------

  The common files for multiple machine families (SPEAr3XX, SPEAr6XX and
  SPEAr13XX) are located in the platform code contained in arch/arm/plat-spear
  with headers in plat/.

  Each machine series have a directory with name arch/arm/mach-spear followed by
  series name. Like mach-spear3xx, mach-spear6xx and mach-spear13xx.

  Common file for machines of spear3xx family is mach-spear3xx/spear3xx.c, for
  spear6xx is mach-spear6xx/spear6xx.c and similarly for spear13xx is
  mach-spear13xx/spear13xx.c. mach-spear* also contain soc/machine
  specific files, like spear300.c, spear310.c, spear320.c and spear600.c.
  Board specific files for each machine type is also contained in mach-spear*
  folder.
