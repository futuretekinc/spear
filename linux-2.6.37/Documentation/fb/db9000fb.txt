Driver for DB9000FB LCD controller
================================

The driver supports the following options, either via
options=<OPTIONS> when modular or video=db9000fb:<OPTIONS> when built in.

For example:
	modprobe db9000fb options=vmem:2M,mode:480x272-24
or on the kernel command line
	video=db9000fb:vmem:2M,mode:480x272-24

vmem: VIDEO_MEM_SIZE
	Amount of video memory to allocate (can be suffixed with K or M
	for kilobytes or megabytes)

mode:XRESxYRES[-BPP]
	XRES: Horizontal resolution, range: 16 to 4096 in units of 16 bytes.
	YRES: Vertical resolution, range: 0 to 4096.
	The number of horizontal lines on the display in pixels

	BPP == The bit depth. Valid values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 18 and 24.

pixclock:PIXCLOCK
	Pixel clock in picoseconds

left:LEFT == left margin, aka Horizontal Back Porch: range: 0 to 255
	in pixclock units
right:RIGHT == right margin, aka Horizontal Front Porch: range: 0 to 255
	in pixclock units
hsynclen:HSYNC == horizonal sync width: range: 0 to 255,
	program with desired width - 1, in pixclock units
upper:UPPER == upper margin, aka Vertical Back Porch, range: 0 to 255
lower:LOWER == lower margin, aka Vertical Front Porch, range: 0 to 255
vsynclen:VSYNC == vertical sync length, range: 0 to 255

hsync:HSYNC
vsync:VSYNC
	Horizontal and vertical sync. 0 => active low, 1 => active
	high.

pixclockpol:POLARITY
	pixel clock polarity
	0 => falling edge, 1 => rising edge

fbp: PACKED == Frame buffer 24 bit mode packing
	In 24 bpp mode, are the 24 bit words
	packed or are arranged 32-bits for each 24-bit word.
	0 => No packing, 24 bits per 32-bit word
	1 => packing, 4 24-bit pixel words every 3 32-bit words

dep:POLARITY
	Data Enable Polarity. 0 => active low, 1 => active high

dee: DMAENDEN
	DMA End Address Enable: 0 => DMA End Address Register (DEAR)
	not used.
	1 => DMA End Address Register (DEAR) used to mark end of
	pixel DMA buffer.

dear: DMAEND
    DMA End address Register: 32-bit decimal offset from beginning
    of DMA Base Address Register used as end of frame buffer memory
    by the core DMA controller.  Used if fbp parameter is set to 1, i.e.
    packing mode.  If this parameter is not specified, then driver will
    calculate dma end.  Include this parameter to override driver calculation.

lps: PORTSELECT
	0 => single LCD output port
	1 => dual output port to LCD

fdw: FIFODMAWORDS
	0 => FIFO request for 4 bus xactions when FIFO has room for
	4 words or more
	1 => FIFO request for 8 bus xactions when FIFO has room for
	8 words or more
	2 => FIFO request for 16 bus xactions when FIFO has room for
	16 words or more

pss: PSRC
	0 => palette loaded from internal palette registers
	1 => palette loaded dynamically from frame buffer

ops: PIXSEL, range: 0 to 3
	0 => 16-bit format 5:6:5, data on msb's of 18-bit LCD interface
	1 => 16-bit format 5:5:5, data on msb's of 18-bit LCD interface
	2 => 16-bit format 5:6:5, data on msb's of 24-bit LCD interface
	3 => 16-bit format 5:5:5, data on msb's of 24-bit LCD interface

rgb: RGBBGR
	0 => RGB format
	1 => BGR format, red and blue pixels swapped

epo: PIXENDIAN, little or big pixel ordering within each byte.
	Valid only for 1, 2, or 4 bpp.
	0 => little endian
	1 => big endian

ebo: ENDIAN, little or big endian byte ordering of pixel data
	0 => little endian
	1 => big endian

pci: INPUTSEL, Pixel Clock Input Select
	0 => Pixel clock derived from Master bus clock or pixel clock divider
	1 => Pixel clock derived from PCLK_IN

pcb: DIVBYPASS, Pixel Clock Divider Bypass
	0 => Pixel clock comes from pixel clock divider
	1 => Pixel clock comes from bus clock

pcd: DIV, Pixel clock divider, range: 0 to 128
	min divide is 2
